+   Weekly Project Progress Update for 2/14      +
+------------------------------------------------+

During the past week I worked on the SQL module for the project. I created a prototype classifier using database entries to try to classify movie names and actor/actress names.
This week I will work on improving the classifier and implementing it in the NLU.
