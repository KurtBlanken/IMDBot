#IMDBot
  IMDBot is a class project for UCSC's CMPS 140/240, a combined graduate/undergraduate course in Artificial Intelligence, with an emphasis on Natural Language Processing.
  The goal is to develop a natural language interface (i.e. chatbot) to the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). The bot should be able to accept trivia queries and preferences in the form of English sentences (an utterance), and respond with the requested information.
